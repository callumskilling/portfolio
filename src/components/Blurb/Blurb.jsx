        <p>I build dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have completed the Front-End Engineer career path on codecademy.com, where I learned how to apply basic design theory, use the command line, and work with front-end frameworks like React and Redux. I have also completed several projects that demonstrate my ability to create responsive, interactive, and user-friendly web applications.</p><br />
        <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills as a front-end engineer. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to create amazing websites that solve real-world problems.</p>
